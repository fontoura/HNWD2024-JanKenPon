This is an open-source implementation of Rock-Paper-Scizors game (Jan Ken Pon). It is a very simple CLI game implemented in C.

This was originally implemented to be used for [ThaySolis](https://github.com/ThaySolis)'s presentation on reverse engineering for the 2024 Hacking na Web Day - Brasilia edition (HNWD 2024 - BrasÃ­lia). If you want to play with reverse engineering, I provided a binary in the releases section.

This software has been tested on Windows and on Linux.

## Building

Requirements (must be in the `PATH`):
* `gcc`
* `make`

Steps:
* Clone the repository.
* Run `make` from the project folder.
* The compiled binary (`jankenpon` on Linux or `jankenpon.exe` on Windows) will be generated.
